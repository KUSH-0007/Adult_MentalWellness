Day 1: Feeling really overwhelmed with work. The deadlines are piling up and I don't know where to start. It's causing a lot of anxiety.
Day 2: Had a slightly better day. Managed to complete one major task, which felt like a small victory. Still feeling the pressure though.
Day 3: Today was tough. A meeting didn't go as planned and I felt criticized. It brought my mood down and I've been feeling sad since.
Day 4: I tried one of the breathing exercises today. It helped me calm down during a moment of panic. I'm feeling a bit more in control.
Day 5: TGIF. I'm exhausted but glad the week is almost over. I feel a sense of relief, but also drained.
Day 6: Spent the day resting and watching movies. It was good to disconnect. Feeling peaceful.
Day 7: Feeling optimistic about the week ahead. Ready to tackle my challenges with a clearer mind. I feel hopeful.
